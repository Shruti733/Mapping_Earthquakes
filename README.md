# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
In this project we are working with earthquakes and tectonic plate data in JSON format and have created map visualizations
using Leaflet Javascript library. We not only created map visualizations in various different views like street, dark,
light etc. but also added various layers to the map like markers, lines etc to highlight specific data points on the map.
We further added popup messages on the map for various data-points that provide extra information to the user clicking on
various data-points on the map making it more interactive.
